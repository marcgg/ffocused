      help: |
        It seems that we are not able to use this photo account because we do not
        have the authorization to access it anymore.<br /><br />

        This can be due to the fact that you didn't connect for a while or maybe
        because you revoked the rights you granted to the ffocused application.<br /><br />

        In any case it's not a big deal, just click the button below to give us the authorization back
        and we'll carry on as usual!
